          <h1 style="text-align: center;">What is Population Collapse?</h1>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            Population collapse refers to a rapid and significant decline in a country's or region's population.
            It is driven by a combination of low fertility rates, aging populations, and reduced immigration.
            As birth rates fall below replacement levels and life expectancy increases, many nations are beginning
            to experience more deaths than births, leading to long-term demographic and economic challenges.

        <h2>1. Birth Rate Below Replacement Level</h2>
        <iframe src="Birth_Rate_Below_Replacement_Level/index.html" width="100%" height="700" style="border:none;"></iframe>
        <p>
          This map shows countries where the birth rate is below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman. Countries in red and orange are experiencing especially low fertility rates, which may lead to long-term population decline if not addressed through immigration or other policies.

        <h2>2. Population Over the Age of 65</h2>
        <iframe src="Population_over_65/population_over_65.html" width="100%" height="700" style="border:none;"></iframe>
        <p>
          The line chart displays a rising global trend in the population aged 65 and over. This indicates longer life expectancy and an aging population, especially in developed countries. It raises concerns about labor shortages and the need for elderly care.

        <h2>3. Population Growth</h2>

        <p>
          These two charts show the extremes of population growth. The first chart highlights countries with the lowest population growth, many of which are developed nations facing low birth rates and aging populations. In contrast, the second chart shows the top 10 countries with the highest population growth, most of which are located in Africa and the Arab world. These nations are experiencing rapid growth due to higher fertility rates and younger populations, which may present both opportunities and challenges in terms of infrastructure, employment, and sustainability.
